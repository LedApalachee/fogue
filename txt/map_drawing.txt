drawing of the map consists of the following steps:
) clear the screen
) make matrix of tiles that player can or could see
) using Bresenham's algorithm fill this matirx with copies of tiles that spotted in player's line of sight
) draw all objects whose IDs are in tiles of this matrix:
	) draw feature, if it's not hidden
	) draw item, if it's not hidden
	) draw creature, if it's not hidden
	) draw player
