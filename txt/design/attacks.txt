A fight starts when one creature attacks another and ends when the defender accepts damage.


Melee attack process:
1) Attacker chooses someone's limb to strike
2) Attacker chooses his own limb to strike with
3) The damage = attacker's weapon's melee damage * (cur condition / max condition) + attacker's strength modifier
4) The defence = defender's armor defence * (cur condition / max condition) + defender's constitution modifier + defender's dexterity modifier
5) If damage > defence, defender's hp is decreased by (damage - defence), otherwise hp is not decreased at all
6) Defender's stricken armor condition is decreased by (k * damage)
7) Attacker's weapon condition is decreased by the same number
8) Check if the defender died and if his armor broke down
9) Check if attacker's weapon broke down


Ranged attack process:
1) Attacker chooses someone's limb to aim at
2) Attacker chooses his limb to shoot with
3) Attacker chooses certain missile
4) The damage = (attacker's weapon's ranged damage * (cur condition / max condition) + missile damage + attacker's strength modifier * if needs strength) / distance
5) The defence = defender's armor defence * (cur condition / max condition) + defender's constitution modifier + defender's dexterity modifier
6) If damage > defence, defender's hp is decreased by (damage - defence), otherwise hp is not decreased at all
7) Defender's stricken armor condition is decreased by (k * damage)
8) Attacker's weapon condition is decreased by this weapon's break number
9) Check if the defender died and if his armor broke down
10) Check is attacker's weapon broke down
