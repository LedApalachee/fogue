Player can make items in Fogue.
This must be done whith special features: a workshop, a kitchen and an alchemery.
Each is intended for its own kinds of items.
Some crafts don't require any feature (player makes item in the same spot).

Each craft takes certain input items, requires one of the three types of feature and gives certain item in result.
Usually, items of category "misc" are needed in a craft, though other categories can be used too.

Crafts also may require player's stats - if some of needed ones is not enough, craft is unavailible.

Also, to do a craft, player must be known of it - he can discover new crafts in various ways:
He can buy a recipe from a vendor.
He can find a recipe somewhere.
He can capture a recipe from a creature.
He can get a recipe as a reward.
He can hear a recipe from creatures' conversations.

The same item can be a result of several crafts - currently, maximum 4 different ones.
