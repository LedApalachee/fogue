There will be merchant deals between creatures and player in Fogue.
I'm planning that every creature is able to trade with player.
But not all creatures do such interactions in the same way: for example, monkeys unlike people don't value some pieces of green paper with some dude drawn on it,
but they definitely would whish to own a bunch or more of bananas. (let them be some smart monkeys that have a minimal idea of what trade deals are)
Eventually, I'm going to come up with a trade system that considers every creature to have its own set of whishes.

Every creature has its own preference rate on each item type.
A preference rate on any item type is from -100 to 100.
An item can be multiple. In this case, preference rate of whole of this item equals item type preference times the number of this item.

1) If player buys something from a creature:
Player picks some item from the vendor and offers some item in return.
The cost = vendor's preference rate on the buyed item - k * player's charisma.
The pay = vendor's preference rate on the offered item - k * vendor's charisma.
If pay > cost, the deal is done.

2) If player sells something to a creature:
Player offers some item to a buyer.
The cost = buyer's preference rate on the offered item + k * player's charisma.
From all items from the buyer's possetion, he offers one which's pay (buyer's preference rate on the buyed item - k * player's charisma) is minimal and is < cost.
If player refuses, then the buyer picks another item on the same principle.
If player agrees, the deal is done.
