You can define your own creatures and items in Fogue by using the data files.
These data files are "data/creatures.txt" and "data/items.txt".
The syntax has the same format for both and looks like this:

# python-like comment
field1 = value1;
field2 = value2;
field3 = value3;
...

"field" is a word from the list of availible fields. These lists differ for creatures.txt and items.txt.
"value" is a number, string or a char, depending on the field's data type.

Arrangement of fields in a definition does not matter except certain ones.

See text files in "design" folder for better understanding how to choose values.
