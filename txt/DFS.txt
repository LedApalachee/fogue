Random Numbers:
() range:
r<lowest>-<highest>  (e.g. r10-15)
"lowest" and "highest" are included in the range

() selecting:
s<number>%<probability>|<number>%<probability> (e.g. s1%20|2%30|3%50)
probability is in percent.
There can be maximum 10 such variants.

In this specification, each field that is availible to be random is marked with "(r)"




Multiple Fields:
A field can represent not only a single value but an array of them.
Each new "F:<value>" on a new line, where "F" is the letter of the field, designates a new array element with the given value.
Example:
B:1:




Colors:
() Black = 0
