DFS - Data File Specification


Chapter 1: the basics

This document specificates the correct form of definition of any data-drivable thing in the game.
These are creatures, items and levels.
A definition generally looks like the following:

{
	F1:V1
	F2:V2
	F3:V3
	...
	Fn:Vn
}

where {} are signs of beginning and ending of a definition;
F1, F2, F3, ..., Fn are [fields], and V1, V2, V3, ..., Vn are their [values]

A [field] is a single character which corresponds to field in struct of its type; each type of defenition has certain set of fields whose position in a definition does not matter

A [value] mostly is a number but it can also be a way more complex structure, such as array of inner values.
A field can correspond not only to a single field in struct but to several fields. In this case its value looks like a list
of numbers that are divided by ';'.
A value that is array of inner values looks like this:

[
	V1
	V2
	V3
	...
	Vn
]

where [] are used to distinguish this array-like value

You can use comments which start with '#'. Such a comment continues untill the line ends
