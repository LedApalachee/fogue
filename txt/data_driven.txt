I'm planning this game developed with data driven design. Each creature is loaded from a file wich contains all information
about this type of creature; either are items and level types

these files are located in folder named "data";
there are "data/creatures.txt", "data/items.txt", "data/levels.txt"

I now am going to try explain the syntax (I'm very bad at teaching any things)

'#' - comment (like in python)
'{' - beginning of a new creature/item description
'}' - ending of a creature/item description
';' - separator
'[' - inner description beginning
']' - inner description ending

so, the generic description looks like this

# in data/creatures.txt

{
	N: goblin  # name of the creature type
	T: 9  # id of the creature type (you must write it yourself so be careful)
	C: G ; 2 ; 0  # character; foreground color; background color
	S: 10 ; 14 ; 9 ; 12  # stats: strength; dexterity; constitution; intelligence

	# body
	B:
	[
		1 ; 2 ; 10 ; 0 ; 1 ; 0; 1  # limb type (head); max_hp of the limb; worn armor type; wielded weapon type; flags: is_vital; can_wield; can_wear
		2 ; 10 ; 20 ; 0 ; 1 ; 0 ; 1  # limb type (torso); ...
		4 ; 4 ; 15 ; 10 ; 0 ; 1 ; 1  # limb type (arm); ...
		...
	]

	# default inventory content
	I: 2 ; 81 ; 91  #  number of items; item_type1; item_type2
}




# in data/items.txt

{
	N: banana
	T: 10
	C: % ; 3 ; 0
	W: 0.25  # weight of the item type (kg)
	c: 4  # category (is it armor, weapon, comestible etc.)

	# 'i' - information that is specific for every item category
	i: 10 ; 0 ; 0  # nutrition; quench; effect type (when is comested)
}


{
	N: treasure map
	T: 124
	C: ? ; 15 ; 0
	W: 0.0125
	c: 5  # note
	i: 1  # type of the note - reveal item
}
