/*    Entity Data File Specification    */

this document specificates proper forms of structuring of data files that describe entities and other structures

There are several certain files which's purpose is to define various entities' properties.
All creatures must be defined in data/creatures.txt
All items must be defined in data/items.txt
All mapobjects must be defined in data/mapobjects.txt
All groups of entities must be defined in data/groups.txt




/*    The Syntax    */

There is a special language you can use to define entities.
The generic syntax is very simple:
<key> = <value>
[ flags enumeration ]
( groups enumeration )
'#' is a comment (like in Python)

The generic form of an entity's definition is the following:

{
	N = <an entity type name>

	<key> = <value>  # some comment
	<key> = <value>

	# some comment
	<key> = <value>
	...

	g[
		<group1>, <group2>,
		<group3>,
		<group4>,
		...
		<groupN>
	]

	f[
		<flag1>, <flag2>,
		<flag3>,
		<flag4>,
		...
		<flagN>
	]
}

'{' indicates of begining of the definition
'}' indicates of ending of the definition

To enumerate set flags you should place them between "f[" and ']'

To enumerate groups the entity is member of, you should place their names between "g[" and ']'




/*    Creatures    */

the structure of a creature's definition is the following:




/*    Items    */

the structure of an item's definition is the following:




/*    Map Objects    */

the structure of a map object's definition is the following:
