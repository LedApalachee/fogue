/*    CAVER    */

Caver is a roguelike, that I'm currently working on.
It is setted in underground - mines, cavers, some other locations.
The player has to dig tunnels, build constructions, fight with enemies and more during the game.
I want this game to be not centered on the player - he is the same creature as any other one.




/*    PLAYER WILL CAN    */

() Dig trough rock
() Mine gems
() Build constructions (blocks, barricades, some aggregates and more)
() Fight with creatures
() Interact with creatures (e.g. hire a rookie from a mayor or trade with a merchant, etc.)
() Interact with environment (e.g. push levers and buttons, engrave walls and floors, etc.)
() Craft things
() Cook




/*    INTERACTIONS    */

All entities can interact with each other
There are always two entities that participate in an interaction:
1) active entity, that acts
2) passive entity, that reacts

Interaction
{
	type
	active entity
	passive entity
	required information // e.g. wich item will be used
	duration // how many turns it will take
}

1) an entity starts an interaction with another entity
2) the game calls proper function to operate this interaction
3) this function does required actions

Interactions may take some time untill finishing. During this time, entities that participate in this interaction will not take their turns and will be marked as busy




/*    BEHAVIOR    */

Every entity can behave its own way: e.g.
